# Welcome to the More-Than-You-Need-To-Know Lounge, a chill place for code that
# you don't need to understand.

# Thanks for stopping by, we hope you find something that catches your eye.
# But don't worry if this stuff doesn't make sense yet -- as long as we know
# how to use code, we don't have to understand everything about it.

# Of course, if you really like this place, stay a while. You can ask a
# teacher about it if you're interested.
